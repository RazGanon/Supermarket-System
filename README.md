As per the requirements listed in the Assignment PDF, the following are the different libraries we used in this phase of our project:
1.	Google gson – This library was used to incorporate json files in our system required for handling raw data.
2.	PostgreSQL – This library was used alongside pgAdmin for the inclusion of the system’s database.
3.	Java Util – This library was used for Arrays, ArrayLists, Scanners etc for a number of different uses.
4.	Java I/O – This library was used to include a BufferReader and FileReader.
5.	Java JUNIT – This library was used for code testing.
6.	Java Lang – This library has minor uses of  java.lang.reflect.Type in order to construct objects of a certain Type to pass as parameters in functions.
7.	Java Time – This library was used to create Date objects instead of string representations of dates.

You can find updated System Instructions and User Manual in the docs directory, there you will find a README PDF with a step-by-step guide to using our system along with the other required information for phase 3 of the project.

(The User Manual was not included in the repository's README.md because it contains images for visualization and is more visibly pleasent for the user as an actual document)
